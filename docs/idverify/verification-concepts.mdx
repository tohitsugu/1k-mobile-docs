BlockID identity verification performs single-source KYC and anti-money laundering verification, delivering a one-stop compliance solution to customers and developers. We combine digital identity checks with reports from credit bureaus, eKYC verifiers, DMVs, and global watchlist data to deliver comprehensive one-stop identity verification with a bring-your-own KYC provider model.

BlockID Identity Verification is used to authenticate documents such as passports, driver's licenses, ID cards, and personally identifiable information, such as social security numbers, tax ID numbers, and birth records. 

The new BlockID Developer API extends our complete identity verification services to others, allowing developers to verify identity documents and personally identifiable information in real-time. Developers can choose the identity assurance their applications need right up to and including KYC, [NIST 800 63-3 standards](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html) for Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2), and Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2).


## **How it Works**

Users will need to download and install the BlockID mobile application. When users first set up the application, they will go through a quick onboarding process to create a private key, enroll their biometric data with TouchID/FaceID, and liveness verification scan using LiveID. LiveID uses a combination of biometric data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to ensure that the user is natural, human, and not a bot or somebody trying to spoof their identity.

Users can also include data from non-physical IDs, such as telco account numbers and banking credentials. For additional use cases, you can also verify a user's social security number with the Social Security Administration, as well as other information - a popular healthcare use case is to confirm if a user is indeed a physician by validating their NPIN (National Physician Information Number).

The more information that is added and verified, the more complete the identity assurance level will be, as defined by [NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html) 


Once verified, your users will have their digital identity for account login or transaction approval rather than a username and password. Having your digital identity proved not only provides users with a positive experience, but the organization also benefits from a high level of certainty for who is at the other end of the digital connection.

## **Verification Types**

We currently offer four levels of identity verification:

|    Verification Type   |  Parameter Name | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:----------------------:|:---------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Social Security Number | `ssn_verify`    | A social security number verification allows users to confirm a user's identity against records from the Social Security Administration.                                                                 |
| Driver's License       | `dl_verify`     | A driver's license (or state ID card) verification allows users to confirm credential data against the databases of the issuing Motor Vehicle Agencies.                                                 |
| Face Liveness          | `face_liveness` | A face liveness verification ensures that a user's visual identity matches the images in their identity documents by performing real-time liveness checks - having a user blink, and smile, for example. |
| Face Compare           | `face_compare`  | A face comparison verification compares the photos from two different source to ensure that the pictures of the person in the identity documents are the same individual.                                   |


### Creating Verification Endpoints

    <img src={IdVerify} alt="IDVerify" />
  </a>



### Requirements

- BlockID SDK - installed and initialized with license key and tenant information.
- Identity Information - Information about the identity you wish to verify. Identity information includes users' names, state driver's license or ID card numbers, and social security numbers.

See [Getting Started](/docs#gettingstarted) for more information on installing and initializing the BlockID SDK.
